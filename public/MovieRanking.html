<h1>My Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 5 favourite moives of all time </h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>Very cool sci-fi film and decent story line</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Again, very detailed sci-fi, and interestingly had consulted physisists for the black hole scene</p>
<h3>Garfield</h3>
<p>I mean, who doesn't love a comedy with Bill Murray playing a talking overweight cat.</p>
<h3>Insidious Chapter 1 & 2</h3>
<p>Both decent horror films but as the series went on it became a bit of a mess</p>
<h3>Cars</h3>
<p>Loved this film growing up, was the best and the original </p>
